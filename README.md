# AutoEncoders

In order to use this code you need to download the moviereviews dataset from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ 
The dataset that was used on this project was the movie lens 1m dataset however you can use any of the dataset (Just make sure 
you have the computational power).
Pytorch needs to be installed on the machine where you want to run the model.

A brief overview about autoencoder can be inferred from the image shown below
